This is a tool for aliasing directories.

normal use:
#setting some aliases (assuming alias 'bar' is not currently set)
$ da /path/to/the/first/directory/ foo
#will switch to the directory and save an alias to it called "foo" for future use
$ cd /path/to/the/second/directory/
$ da bar
#since alias 'bar' is unset, will prompt if it should be saved
#if you answer yes, saves an alias to the current directory named "bar"
#alternatively, you may specify another directory to save instead of the current directory

$ da
#like cd, without any arguments, da will switch to the home directory
$ da -
#also, like cd, da - will switch to the previous working directory

#aliases foo and bar were saved above
$ da foo #will cd to /path/to/the/first/directory
$ da bar #will cd to /path/to/the/second/directory

$ da ls #list all aliases
$ da ls foo #list all aliases that contain the string 'oo'. (supports some regular expressions)

$ da del bar #delete the alias named 'bar'

$ da help #print help
